# SQIsign on STM32F429I-DISC1

This repository contains the work carried out as part of my master's thesis. The main objective was to evaluate and adapt the second version of SQIsign (https://github.com/SQIsign/the-sqisign/tree/nist-v2), proposed in the context of the NIST competition, to a platform with ARM Cortex-M4 processor.

To achieve this, the STM32F429I-DISC1 (https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html) development board was used as the target platform.

## Repository contents

+ SQIsign_data.xlsx: contains all the data collected during the experimentation, along with an initial analysis.

+ thesis_presentation_draft.pdf: a draft version of the thesis presentation.

+ Tools/: various tools developed or used during the experimentation.

+ SQIsign_X_STM32F429I-DISC1/: folders containing the SQIsign adaptations for the STM32F429I-DISC1 board as "stm32 project" format, where X corresponds to the security level (level1, level3, level5).
